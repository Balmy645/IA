## Where are the XMLs?

Most of the xmls where **not** added intentionally.

Why? Because most of them are way to heavy to be supported by the git hub API, and sadly this isn´t a chromiun fork repo. 

## Why not a secondary service to upload the files 

I would have, if my account creation limit given a phone number hasn´t reached the limit. 

## List of XML files

- modelo_eigenfaces9.xml (1.03~ GB)
- cnn_event_detection_model.h5 (39.8~ MB)
