A repository made to collect all the final projects made for the assignature


## Where are the XMLs?

Most of the xmls where **not** added intentionally.

Why? Because most of them are way to heavy to be supported by the git hub API, and sadly this isn´t a chromiun fork repo. 

## Why not a secondary service to upload the files 

I would have, if my account creation limit given a phone number hasn´t reached the limit. (Will try to find a way around it and update the links or folder link on the bottom of this file!)
